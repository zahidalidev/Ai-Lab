# a)
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of
# words below. listOfWords = [APPLE, BILBO, CHORUSED, DISIMAGINE,
# ENSURING, FORMALISING, GLITCHES, HARMINE, INDENTATION, JACKED,
# KALPACS, LAUNDRY, MASKED, NETTED, OXFORD, PARODY, QUOTIENTS,
# RACERS, SADNESS, THYREOID, UNDUE, VENT, WEDGED, XERIC, YOUTHHOOD,
# ZIFFS]
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
